# 🌸 Flower Classification & 👕 Fashion MNIST Classification using Deep Learning

This repository contains two deep learning projects built using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## 📁 Project 1: Flower Image Classification using CNN

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Build a CNN model to classify images of flowers into five categories: daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, and tulips.

### ✅ Key Features:
- Data downloaded from TensorFlow dataset repo
- CNN with convolutional + max pooling layers
- Model evaluation with accuracy/loss plots
- Predicts class of new flower image

### 📈 Result:
Achieved good training and validation accuracy, with the model able to classify unseen flower images confidently.

## 📁 Project 2: Fashion MNIST Classification using MLP

### 📌 Problem Statement:
Develop a Multi-Layer Perceptron to classify grayscale images of clothing/accessory items into 10 categories.

### ✅ Key Features:
- Flattened and normalized input images
- 4-layer MLP built using Dense layers
- Compiled using SGD (and tested with Adam)
- Prediction results with accuracy evaluation

### 📈 Result:
Achieved strong performance in image classification with options to improve using optimizers or CNN.
